of Chaos","icon":"","description":"At the beginning of time-no, even before that-there was <a data-href=\"Chaos\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/chaos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos</a>. From this Chaos erupted <a data-href=\"The First Dragons\" href=\"remote-blog/factions/the-first-dragons.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The First Dragons</a>. Eventually, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Unavi, the Enchanted Dragon\" data-href=\"Unavi, the Enchanted Dragon\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/unavi,-the-enchanted-dragon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unavi</a> managed to tap into the powers of <a data-href=\"Chaos Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/magics/chaos-magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos Magic</a>, which developed into an art that was necessary to master for any dragons or else they would suffer death at the hands of another. These powerful <a data-href=\"Chaos Dragons\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/chaos-dragons.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos Dragons</a> only grew more and more powerful as they procreated, as it takes Chaos to form a dragon, and some of the Chaos of the parents would be inherited into the offspring, creating a positive feedback loop. As these dragons became more and more dense with Chaos, they were able to better control the unpredictable nature of Chaos Magic, however, this caused them to generally be weaker in return with what they could manage in these controlled situations. As a solution, a dragon known as <a data-href=\"Aternos\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/aternos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Aternos</a> performed an incredibly powerful spell with Chaos Magic that caused the energies of chaos to condense into a variety of different weaker energies that weaved together to create <a data-href=\"Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/magics/magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magic</a> in an event known as the <a data-href=\"Unification of Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/events/unification-of-magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unification of Magic</a>. This, of course, was only able to be done due to Aternos' increased Chaos Magic control, and the massacre of 20% of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Dragons\" data-href=\"Dragons\" href=\"remote-blog/races/dragons.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dragon-kind</a>. This massacre was done so that Aternos had enough Chaos energy to actually perform the giant spell that was the Unification of Magic. Once Chaos was split into threads and weaved into the fluid and malleable energy of Magic, the Age of Chaos came to a close.The last year of the Age of Chaos is 0 Cs (Meaning Chaos). Going closer to the dawn of time increases it by 1 for every year./","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Year System","level":4,"id":"Year_System_0"}],"links":["remote-blog/concepts/chaos.html","remote-blog/factions/the-first-dragons.html","remote-blog/characters/unavi,-the-enchanted-dragon.html","remote-blog/magics/chaos-magic.html","remote-blog/concepts/chaos-dragons.html","remote-blog/characters/aternos.html","remote-blog/magics/magic.html","remote-blog/events/unification-of-magic.html","remote-blog/races/dragons.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"remote-blog/ages/age-of-chaos.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762323255261,"modifiedTime":1768076113199,"sourceSize":1657,"sourcePath":"remote-blog/Ages/Age of Chaos.md","exportPath":"remote-blog/ages/age-of-chaos.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":2,"backlinks":["remote-blog/characters/arem.html","remote-blog/characters/aternos.html","remote-blog/concepts/dragon-tongue.html","remote-blog/events/unification-of-magic.html","remote-blog/factions/the-first-dragons.html","remote-blog/main-timeline.html"],"type":"markdown"},"remote-blog/ages/age-of-fatigue.html":{"title":"Age of Fatigue","icon":"","description":"It is 232 DB.

On another note, with the promise of great power were one to obtain The Egg, He Who Watches began to gain excitement from watching people fight over it and compete for resources, technology, land, and artifacts. Examples of how the entire world was now aware of The Egg can be seen with groups of <a data-href=\"Humans\" href=\"remote-blog/races/humans.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Humans</a> that partook in the actions of things like the <a data-href=\"1st SMP\" href=\"remote-blog/smps/1st-smp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">1st SMP</a> and <a data-href=\"2nd SMP\" href=\"remote-blog/smps/2nd-smp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2nd SMP</a>. Those examples didn't go too crazy, so He Who Watches will not have cared, but there were also cases where people really fell for his game and became his source of entertainment. One example of this is the events of the <a data-href=\"3rd SMP\" href=\"remote-blog/smps/3rd-smp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">3rd SMP</a>.

In this period of time, He Who Watches gets angry and tries to find Gareth, but finds his efforts barred due to a mysterious power coming from the destroyed <a data-href=\"Tower of the Eternal Eclipse\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/tower-of-the-eternal-eclipse.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tower of the Eternal Eclipse</a>. This force, of course, was the spirit of <a data-href=\"Xavier\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/xavier.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xavier</a> that he had tied to the ruined landmark before dying. In the mean time, Magic starts to come back somewhat as it has been sometime since The Egg was used in its fractured form to abuse its power, though it is still much weaker than it once was. During this time, the <a data-href=\"4th SMP\" href=\"remote-blog/smps/4th-smp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">4th SMP</a> would also take place. With He Who Watches now at his weakest, he begins to get desperate, and starts to make small influences all over the world in hopes of creating <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Followers of He\" data-href=\"Followers of He\" href=\"remote-blog/factions/followers-of-he.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">zealots</a> ambitious enough to come and boost his power either through some form of <a data-href=\"Oath\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/oath.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oath</a> or by stopping Gareth.It is at this point that the story of the final SMP will take place.<br>The same year system as the <a data-href=\"Era of Prosperity\" href=\"remote-blog/ages/era-of-prosperity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Era of Prosperity</a> is used (DB).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Year System","level":4,"id":"Year_System_0"}],"links":["remote-blog/events/probot-massacre.html","remote-blog/artifacts/the-egg.html","remote-blog/concepts/chaos.html","remote-blog/magics/magic.html","remote-blog/characters/prodigy-child-(probot).html","remote-blog/factions/bearer-of-the-egg.html","remote-blog/locations/deisomnia.html","remote-blog/locations/novum-optimus.html","remote-blog/races/humans.html","remote-blog/smps/1st-smp.html","remote-blog/smps/2nd-smp.html","remote-blog/smps/3rd-smp.html","remote-blog/characters/gareth-of-ishoria.html","remote-blog/locations/scramloria-(the-sunless-realm).html","remote-blog/events/his-weakening.html","remote-blog/locations/tower-of-the-eternal-eclipse.html","remote-blog/characters/xavier.html","remote-blog/smps/4th-smp.html","remote-blog/factions/followers-of-he.html","remote-blog/concepts/oath.html","remote-blog/ages/era-of-prosperity.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"remote-blog/ages/age-of-fatigue.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762323255262,"modifiedTime":1768076113200,"sourceSize":2546,"sourcePath":"remote-blog/Ages/Age of Fatigue.md","exportPath":"remote-blog/ages/age-of-fatigue.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":3,"backlinks":["remote-blog/characters/salgus,-the-carrier.html","remote-blog/factions/followers-of-he.html"],"type":"markdown"},"remote-blog/ages/dragon-age.html":{"title":"Dragon Age","icon":"","description":"Following the <a data-href=\"Unification of Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/events/unification-of-magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Unification of Magic</a>, other beings began to be born, and the interwoven pieces of <a data-href=\"Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/magics/magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magic</a> would coalesce into various forms of matter.

As such, humans would harvest dragons for advancing their magical technologies and prowess.

It is in this sense we begin to see that those who care to record the history of the world from this point onwards is almost entirely composed of humans, as it was seen that no other race showed any signs of prosperity in this time. In a fate much akin to our own world, humans would rape the world of its resources with little concern of any adverse effects to come in the future.

One of these mages, <a data-href=\"Xavier\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/xavier.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xavier</a>, came to grow discontent towards the way the world was advancing.<br>Before Xavier left, there was a roughly 3 year period where the nation that Ovus was from, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Magus Optimus\" data-href=\"Magus Optimus\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/magus-optimus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Magalo</a> reformed into <a data-href=\"Novum Optimus\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/novum-optimus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Novum Optimus</a> as the Bearers of the Egg took control as a council to lead the growing nation.<br>As a result, Xavier stole the current <a data-href=\"Prodigy\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/prodigy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prodigy</a> from the chambers they were held in in order to seal them away from the rest of the world permanently. This was because the others Bearers were speaking of using the Prodigy to open <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos\" data-href=\"Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/zataukeru,-grave-of-aternos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zataukeru</a> and bring about the <a data-href=\"Second Coming of the Dragon Age\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/second-coming-of-the-dragon-age.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Second Coming of the Dragon Age</a>. To accomplish this goal of sealing them away, Xavier took the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Prodigy Child (Probot)\" data-href=\"Prodigy Child (Probot)\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/prodigy-child-(probot).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prodigy Child</a> to <a data-href=\"Dragonia\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/dragonia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Dragonia</a> and performed a great spell at the <a data-href=\"Tower of the Eternal Eclipse\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/tower-of-the-eternal-eclipse.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tower of the Eternal Eclipse</a> alongside likeminded individuals of both great strength (<a data-href=\"Order of the Eclipse\" href=\"remote-blog/factions/order-of-the-eclipse.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Order of the Eclipse</a>) and of great weakness (Those who would come to inhabit this land). From that moment on, the lands of Dragonia were repurposed into <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)\" data-href=\"Scramloria (The Sunless Realm)\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/scramloria-(the-sunless-realm).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Scramloria</a>. The Prodigy Child, and all other members of the Order of the Eclipse, took refuge deep within <a data-href=\"Shadow's Peak\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/shadow's-peak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shadow's Peak</a> where they were tasked with guarding the Prodigy.<br>For a long time, the nation of <a data-href=\"Novum Optimus\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/novum-optimus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Novum Optimus</a> took concern in losing one of the Bearers, but with no means of finding where Xavier had gone, they were left only with the option of putting up wanted posters and hoping for the best, and even that proved futile. Many years later, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sintel, Keeper of Halüges\" data-href=\"Sintel, Keeper of Halüges\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/sintel,-keeper-of-halüges.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sintel</a> came across the emanating feeling of <a data-href=\"Draconic Magic\" href=\"remote-blog/magics/draconic-magic.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Draconic Magic</a> from outside the barrier of Scramloria, and began to be suspicious of what lied within the random dome that had mysteriously appeared over Dragonia 32 years past. This emanating Draconic Magic was of course coming from <a data-href=\"Siethun\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/siethun.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Siethun</a> who resided within. As a result, Sintel raised this to the other Bearers of the Egg and received permission to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Fall of Scramloria\" data-href=\"Fall of Scramloria\" href=\"remote-blog/events/fall-of-scramloria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">siege</a> upon the dome barrier surrounding Scramloria to see what lies within, especially because its formation coincides with the time period Xavier had gone missing.<br>This of course led to the barrier weakening, allowing Sintel to slip in, battle Xavier, destroy the Tower of the Eternal Eclipse, cause mass panic, create bouts of <a data-href=\"Nightfall\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/nightfall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Nightfall</a>, kill Siethun, reveal the hiding place of the Prodigy Child, and then inevitably die to the hands of Xavier himself. Of course, it was too late for Scramloria, and all residents of the region-save <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Gareth of Ishoria\" data-href=\"Gareth of Ishoria\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/gareth-of-ishoria.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Gareth</a>-perished from a mix of the armies and Nightfall. Additionally, the entire Order of the Eclipse was slain, and Xavier died as a sacrifice when performing the rite that accomplished the <a data-href=\"Prodigy's Disembodiment\" href=\"remote-blog/events/prodigy's-disembodiment.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Prodigy's Disembodiment</a>. Of course, before doing so Xavier tied a small piece of his own essence to the Tower of the Eternal Eclipse's ruins.<br>Following the Fall of Scramloria, the Prodigy Child began to slowly gain control over the world even without a corporeal form, which was first manifested through whispering and feelings of being watched leading to the name He Who Watches being coined.

These people that accompanied him were allowed to exit at any time, and it was treated as a reprieve from the world outside. Furthermore, those that wished to carry out diplomatic relations often opted to do so within Salganoia if they could, as it was protected entirely under the rule of a Dragon. Countless artifacts deemed too dangerous were often stolen or brought before the pocket dimension to be stored away from those with a heart full of wrath. There were even many cases of Dragon Historians opting to never leave the pocket dimension and instead remain in contact with Salgus.<br>Those with access to Chaos Magic can brute force their way into Salganoia, and with great effort most with all affinities could likely replicate these results, albeit with much more difficulty. The only case of someone brute forcing their way in was <a data-href=\"Havus, The First Prodigy\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/havus,-the-first-prodigy.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Havus, The First Prodigy</a>, and this was only due to the knowledge of the location of <a data-href=\"Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/zataukeru,-grave-of-aternos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zataukeru, Grave of Aternos</a> being known by the scholars within. This action, of course, weakened the original spell and thus it now holds an incompleteness such that upon the death of Salgus, the pocket dimension will flood out from their corpse and desecrate the nearby land.<br>Salgus, during the <a data-href=\"Era of Prosperity\" href=\"remote-blog/ages/era-of-prosperity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Era of Prosperity</a>, often chose to hide away as he saw it mostly obsolete to ask of people to run from their world now that it was seemingly much better off. This doesn’t mean he never explored though, and eventually he ran into <a data-href=\"Grandun, The Great Dragon\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/grandun,-the-great-dragon.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grandun, The Great Dragon</a>, who commemorated Salgus’ capabilities even as a lesser Dragon, and offered an <a data-href=\"Oath\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/oath.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Oath</a> to increase his power, to which Salgus turned down. Instead, Grandun mentioned a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Arthas\" data-href=\"Arthas\" href=\"remote-blog/locations/arthas.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">society</a> that he had seen flourish over a millennia ago. He told Salgus that there may exist Humans there that would interest him due to their vast intellect. When Salgus visited the area Grandun told him about however, he found nothing but a barren plains. There was, however, one lone <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Artificiods\" data-href=\"Artificiods\" href=\"remote-blog/races/artificiods.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Artificiod</a> named <a data-href=\"Jexus\" href=\"remote-blog/characters/jexus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Jexus</a> that had been attempting to run from his people, but was scared of what may become of him. As a result, Jexus agreed to enter Salgus’ pocket dimension, despite being unsure of if even that was a safe option.<br>As time went on, and it became the <a data-href=\"Age of Fatigue\" href=\"remote-blog/ages/age-of-fatigue.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Age of Fatigue</a>, Salgus often visited the world less, of which he felt guilty.

As a result, Salgus is very interested in methods of permanently destroying the Prodigy Cycle, believing it to be unnecessary in maintaining the flow of <a data-href=\"Chaos\" href=\"remote-blog/concepts/chaos.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Chaos</a> when <a data-href=\"The Egg\" href=\"remote-blog/artifacts/the-egg.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Egg</a> already seemed to create more than enough flow previously.<br>Jexus and the Dragon Scholars within Salganoia often work together now making requests to Salgus to allow them out at certain locations for brief periods of time to learn more of how to combat He Who Watches.

It isn't necessarily gravity, but the magic of a person is bound by some barrier that the soul forms. As magic is the fundamental force that forms all beings, a soul being it's bounding force makes it a rather fundamental part of your identity. Furthermore, when the soul is separated from the body, magic tends to form a stretched hourglass shape having a bulb where the soul is and where the body is. With this, one can technically extend the control of their most potent magic past just the bounds of their soul, but it can place the user at a great risk.

Dead creatures with a lot of energy or things with a lot of energy in general can form into mountains or glaciers. These glaciers will overtime carve out landscapes like lakes and rivers. Water can generally form too but only as a result of storms that can stir up from heavier fluctuations deriving from the anomaly.

This sun object isn’t quite like our own, and it works in a way where a majority of the light it produces gets cast beneath it in a cone, where as rays originating from higher up it would be progressively dimmer. This is because less chaos energy reaches the higher parts of the object as opposed to the bottom parts. However, the chaos that goes into it and moves it around can also cause it to rotate as an object slightly and can make the brightest parts of the sun aim in different directions than it usually would for some time before it settles to normal.A giant continent in the very center of Navu that holds the Anomaly and houses many powerful creatures due to the aforementioned artifact.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<mark>Features</mark>:","level":2,"id":"==Features==_0"},{"heading":"Medrum","level":3,"id":"Medrum_0"}],"links":["remote-blog/concepts/dragon-tongue.html","remote-blog/races/dragons.html","remote-blog/artifacts/anomaly.html","remote-blog/concepts/chaos.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"remote-blog/locations/navu.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1762323255282,"modifiedTime":1768076113214,"sourceSize":2346,"sourcePath":"remote-blog/Locations/Navu.md","exportPath":"remote-blog/locations/navu.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":76,"backlinks":["remote-blog/ages/dragon-age.html","remote-blog/artifacts/anomaly.html","remote-blog/characters/helga,-the-elder-goddess.html","remote-blog/characters/yunem.html","remote-blog/concepts/soul.html","remote-blog/locations/magus-optimus.html","remote-blog/locations/mount-daragon.html"],"type":"markdown"},"remote-blog/locations/novum-optimus.html":{"title":"Novum Optimus","icon":"","description":"Latin for \"new/fresh\" and \"the best/aristocratic\".
